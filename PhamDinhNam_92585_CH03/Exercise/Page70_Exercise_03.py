Problem:
    Explain the role of the variable in the header of a for loop.
Solution:
    When Python executes the type of for loop just discussed, it counts from 0 to the value of the header’s integer expression minus 1.
    On each pass through the loop, the header’s variable is bound to the current value of this count.
